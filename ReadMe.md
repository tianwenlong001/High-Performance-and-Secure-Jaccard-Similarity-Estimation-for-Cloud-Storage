# Horse-MinHash-Java

## An Implementation of Horse-MinHash in Java

Horse-MinHash is a high-performance and secure Jaccard similarity estimator that achieves higher accuracy than traditional MinHash and its variants.

Additionally, it exhibits superior performance in Jaccard similarity estimation, particularly when the block size is 16KB or larger.

## Requirements:

- Requires at least **Java 17**.

## Examples

- To generate Horse-MinHash signatures for two files and estimate their Jaccard similarity, you can utilize the Command Prompt (CMD) to execute the Horse-MinHash.jar file.

- Use the following command in CMD to run the JAR file: `java -jar [absolute path to Horse-MinHash.jar]`.

- Horse-MinHash requires three input parameters: the first two are the file paths for which you want to calculate Jaccard similarity, and the third is the user-defined size of the Horse-MinHash signature.
